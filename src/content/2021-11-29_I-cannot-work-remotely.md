excerpt: In a world rampaged by COVID-19, the world moved to remote, but I cannot follow.

2020/2021 has been the hardest period of time for most of us. The world changed almost overnight, and we had to go from seeing people all the time
to seeing people only when we had to. We [tried to] social distance and wore masks. A cough or a sneeze induced a sense of panic, and in-person work environments went remote. I transitioned jobs not once, but twice.

Over these past two years, I have slowly come to realize something. **I am not happy.** I do not enjoy working remotely like I did when I was in an office. This is not how I expected to feel, which is probably why it has taken me so long to realize it. Initially, this felt just like a lack of motivation or ability to focus or be productive. I slowly felt dead inside, and that the work I was doing was not worthwhile. It was almost impossible for me to start a task, or drive it to completion unless there was an external sense of pressure that helped drive me. The work itself did not feel rewarding. Eventually, the lack of productivity was noticed by my manager, and I was asked to leave.

I started at another remote company, and for a long time, things seemed much better. It was a better role. It was better work. It was a better life. I was happy.... for a time. In October 2021 I got married to my wife, a person I am so lucky to be with. After our honeymoon, I returned to work only to find I was not really looking forward to work. I became frustrated and encountered a very similar pattern as I had before. The work was no longer rewarding. This was crazy to me, as never before in my career has this been an issue.

The thing that has taken the longest to realize, is that it's not just the work that I need, but human connection as a part of it. I have found that I work best in an in-person environment, having face-to-face conversations and working with people. I need a sense of comradery you can only find in person as part of my team. Video calls help but do not solve the problem. I am motivated by the people around me, and without that, I cannot be productive.

Moving forward, I am seeking in-person opportunities, be it in-office or hybrid with 1 or 2 days remote. I am sure any future employers will judge me for this, but I also believe it's important to document my journey at this time. Honestly, if any employer will not hire me because I am less productive being remote, it's their loss, and I am happier for it.

I am sure I am not the only one who has felt this way, so please let me know below if that is the case. I would love to hear about your experiences.
